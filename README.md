# I Have an Idea for an App, Should I build it?
A few years ago I had an idea for an app. But I knew nothing about coding, or app building. I still don't know about app building, but I think I've learned a thing or two about coding.

This reposistory contains a notebook [here](https://github.com/jessedeans/App_and_Play_Store_Analysis/blob/master/App_and_Play_Store_Analysis_Notebook.ipynb) and data [here](https://github.com/jessedeans/App_and_Play_Store_Analysis/blob/master/AppleStore.csv) and [here](https://github.com/jessedeans/App_and_Play_Store_Analysis/blob/master/googleplaystore.csv) to answer my question.

In the [notebook](https://github.com/jessedeans/App_and_Play_Store_Analysis/blob/master/App_and_Play_Store_Analysis_Notebook.ipynb) I  analyze data to determine what kind of free apps are likely to attract more users and be more popular on both the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store. A popular app has a better chance of generating ad revenue. Which would be necessary since a paid version of my idea already exists on the Apple App Store. After determining the types of apps that are popular. I'll decide if my idea has a chance.

The notebook is based on a guided project from [Dataquest.io](https://www.dataquest.io), an online platform to learn Data Analysis and Data Science. The learning goal of the project was to review common data types, lists, for loops, conditional statements, dictionaries, and functions, so no pandas were used in this code. I tweaked the project to apply to my own experinces described above.
