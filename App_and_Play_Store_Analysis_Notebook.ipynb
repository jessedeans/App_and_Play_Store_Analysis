    "Should I build my app? From my quick analysis the answer is no,  not if I intend it to be profitable. The Travel app market is dominated by large travel company apps. So it could be hard to get noticed in this genre. Furthermore it is not the most popular app genre, a reasonably priced paid version already exists on the App Store, and on further inspection, three free versions exist on the Play Store. \n",
    "\n",
    "From my analysis, a reference app would be the best to create. Specifically, it seems that taking a popular book  and turning it into an app could be profitable for both the Google Play and the App Store markets. "
